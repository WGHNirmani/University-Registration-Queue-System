# University Registration Queue System

This project identifies and analyzes the **University Registration Queue System** as a complex system with measurable performance characteristics.

---

## Overview
The system manages student registration queues digitally, optimizing waiting times and resource utilization during peak registration periods.

---

## Problem Statement
During registration, students often face long queues and uneven counter workloads.  
This leads to delays, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies.

---

## Performance Objectives
- Minimize waiting time  
- Maximize throughput  
- Identify bottlenecks  
- Optimize resource allocation  
- Improve scalability

---

## Data Set
| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Student_ID | Unique identifier for each student |
| Arrival_Time | Time student joins queue |
| Service_Start_Time | Time service begins |
| Service_End_Time | Time service ends |
| Counter_ID | Counter handling registration |
| Waiting_Time | Time between arrival and being served |
| Processing_Time | Time taken for registration |

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Waiting time reduced from **15 mins â†’ under 5 mins**  
- **25% improvement** in throughput  
- Balanced counter utilization  
- Better student satisfaction
